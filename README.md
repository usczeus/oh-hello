# oh-hello

I'm a man of medium height and agreeable countenance, but look older than my years. Not very muscular but show signs of strength. Yet there is something not healthy in my face. It is rather thin, cheeks are hollow, and there is an unhealthy sallowness in their colour. My rather large prominent dark eyes have an expression of determination and yet there is a vague look in them. Even when I am excited and talking irritably my eyes do not follow my mood, but betray something else, sometimes quite incongruous with what is passing. "It's hard to tell what he's thinking," those who talk to me declare. People who see something pensive and sullen in my eyes are startled by my sudden laugh, which bears witness to mirthful and light-hearted thoughts at the very time when my eyes are so gloomy. It is true that I am irascible by nature, "of an unstable and unbalanced mind" as some happily describe me.
